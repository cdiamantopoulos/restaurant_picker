General Overview:

Restaurant Lunch Picker. This is an idea that has spawned while discussing lunch options at work. We certainly haven't been the first, and we won't be the last. The goal of this project is to get random lunch options when nobody can decide what to eat.

Current Features:
* Add Restaurant
* Delete Restaurant
* Restaurant List


Features to Implement:

* Random Restaurant
  * This should be able to return an amount of options based on input, whether or not we want a quick or sitdown lunch, and approximate price we feel like spending.
* I think that's it for now. Anything else we decide on.

Misc TODO: 
* Write tests
* Create API for a HipChat bot
